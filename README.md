Comments to Evaluators/Design Notes: 
	The connection string for the database is located in appsettings.json. If the database is empty, it is populated with test data. DbInitialize
initializes the database schema and data (if empty). 
	Department: The homepage redirects to the Computer Science Department view. This lists all CS courses, and each course links to a department view of the
course.
	Course: (Note: There is a 'department course view' that is not the same as the professor view.)
	The department course view allows learning outcomes to be added, deleted and modified. The evaluation metrics and sample files aren't currently
displayed - this webpage is currently intended to show functionality for editing learning outcomes. For assignment purposes, on the top right, it will
indicate that it is the department view, and the professor view can be seen by clicking 'Go To Professor View'. The professor view displays learning
outcomes, evaluation metrics and samples files. Evalutation metric and sample file editing aren't currently enabled, but the forms for creating are
displayed in modals.
	C# string to HTML: To view the webpage built in C# with a string go to https://localhost:44328/String/Index?Dept=CS&Num=4540&Sem=Fall&Year=2019 and compare
to https://localhost:44328/Course/Course?Dept=CS&Num=4540&Sem=Fall&Year=2019. (Any course may be selected, just change Course/Course to String/Index in the
route for comparison.) The code from the Razor page is essentially identical to that in the C# string, the C# string is generated by adding strings together
with data.
	Note the courses listed in the nav bar may not match those in the database and are there as examples - go to all courses to see all courses in the
database.
	The creation/editing/deleting webpages maintained a simple design for this assignment. There are also pages to list all courses and learning outcomes
for easy access to check database updates.
