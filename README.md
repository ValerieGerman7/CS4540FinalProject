Comments to Evaluators: 
  The navbar was changed to use a bootstrap navbar, including a dropdown and button. In both of the course and overview pages, cards were used to 
  organize the information. Buttons were designed with bootstrap css. Modals were used to demonstrate pop-ups for adding evaluation metrics or
  sample files. Bootstrap styling was used in the forms on those modals.
